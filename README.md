# Hello! 

This profile showcases my portfolio of data science and machine learning projects, spanning from tutorial-based implementations to original work. Projects are created using Python and Jupyter notebooks, but often in Google Colab.

## Projects

### Linear Regression from Scratch
Going into Linear Regression but without any Scikit-learn! This project emphasizes a lot of the Mathematics behind Linear Regression by building one from scratch. At the end, we see a comparison of the results of my model to those of scikit-learn, and the R^2 values are very similar.

- Tools: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn (for comparison)
- Concepts: Derivatives, Linear Regression, Gradient Descent, Multicollinearity, Feature Engineering, Standardizing, etc.
- Datasets used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bismasajjad/global-ai-job-market-and-salary-trends-2025

### Exploratory Data Analysis + Linear Regression - Esports
This project goes into using Data Analysis techniques and some Linear Regression to look into Player/Team Earnings based on factors like the type of game played, total tournaments played, etc.

- Tools: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- Concepts: Linear Regression, Feature Engineering, Scatterplot and boxplots, etc.
- Datasets: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackdaoud/esports-earnings-for-players-teams-by-game

### California House Pricing Prediction - Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wqmtf9SA_kk&t=54s&ab_channel=NeuralNine
A beginner-friendly project using linear regression to predict house prices in California based on features like location, income, and population. This project helps build foundational skills in data preprocessing, visualization, and regression modeling.

- Tools: Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn 
- Concepts: Linear Regression, Feature Engineering, Model Evaluation

### Learning Random Forest Regression - Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUsx5ZNlYWc&t=601s&ab_channel=Ryan%26MattDataScience
A notebook focused on learning how Random Forest Regression works, implemented using Scikit-learn. It demonstrates how ensemble methods improve predictions compared to simpler models.

- Tools: Scikit-learn, NumPy
- Concepts: Decision Trees, Random Forests, Overfitting vs. Generalization

## How to Run

Mostly all notebooks are built in Google Colab. You can open and run them using the Colab badge or by uploading to your Google Drive.

## About

All repositories serve to track my learning and share my work in data science and machine learning.
